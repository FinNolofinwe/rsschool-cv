    **Work experience:**
    
    I have no experience in development yet.  

    After graduating from university in 2017, I worked as an environmental engineer for six months, and after
    that I became Sales Manager of engineering equipment in another company.  During this time, I have
    learned to perform complex tasks based on communication with people, carefully grasp in technical and
    contractual documentation, and also prioritize tasks, which is also an important part of the workflow.
    I can say that I have improved my soft-skills well.
 
    In May 2020, I interested in development and decided to try myself in that.  I had started with the
    basics - HTML & CSS, and later began to master JavaScript.  I try to devote a significant part of
    my free time to studying after my main job.  During these six months, I had no desire to give up, because
    the development gives me pleasure from the process.  I am glad that I have found a work that I like.
    Programming also teaches you to think more broadly, that effects positively to ordinary life)

          var fact = 1;
            while (n) {
              fact *= n--;
            }
          return fact;
            } else {
            throw new RangeError();
            }
        }
